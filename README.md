# EXNO2DS
# AIM:
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the given data set.
      
# EXPLANATION:
  The primary aim with exploratory analysis is to examine the data for distribution, outliers and anomalies to direct specific testing of your hypothesis.
  
# ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Import the required packages to perform Data Cleansing,Removing Outliers and Exploratory Data Analysis.

STEP 2: Replace the null value using any one of the method from mode,median and mean based on the dataset available.

STEP 3: Use boxplot method to analyze the outliers of the given dataset.

STEP 4: Remove the outliers using Inter Quantile Range method.

STEP 5: Use Countplot method to analyze in a graphical method for categorical data.

STEP 6: Use displot method to represent the univariate distribution of data.

STEP 7: Use cross tabulation method to quantitatively analyze the relationship between multiple variables.

STEP 8: Use heatmap method of representation to show relationships between two variables, one plotted on each axis.

#SUMMARY

This script does an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. It starts by loading the dataset, showing basic details, setting PassengerId as the index, and creating summary statistics. For categorical data, it uses value_counts(), and for univariate analysis, it makes countplots of the Survived column and checks unique values in passenger class. In bivariate analysis, it uses countplots, catplots, and boxplots to study relationships like Age vs Survived. For multivariate analysis, it compares Pclass, Age, Gender, and Survived together using boxplots and catplots. Finally, it uses heatmaps and pairplots to find patterns and correlations, giving a clear picture of survival trends and relationships in the dataset.

      










        








# RESULT
Thus, the Exploratory Data Analysis on the given data set was performed successfully.
